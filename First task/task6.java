// 6. write a program that prints the following output:

// A well-formed Java program has a main method with { and } braces.



// A System.out.println statement has ( and ) and usually a String that starts and ends with a " character.

// (But we type \" instead!)

// What is the difference between

// a ' and a "?  Or between a " and a \"?



// One is what we see when we're typing our program. The other is what appears on the "console."
